    <h1>OLE to Jakarta</h1>
    <p>I embarked on a 5 day overseas learning experience to Jakarta as part of a student exchange program. There I had the chance to experience what it was like to be a student in Jakarta, and also the diverse cultures found there.</p>
    <p>I also had a buddy who had arrived to Singapore a few weeks prior as part of the exchange program. We spent time with each other and learnt much about how different our lives are despite our close geographical proximities.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, I took part in some of their normal lessons where I experienced what it was like learning in their school. We were there for 3 days to fully immerse ourselves in the experience.</p>
